Instead of treating curves as isolated gestures, the geometry is carried consistently across plan and elevation: corners relax into arcs, ledges thicken into continuous bands, and the perimeter reads as a single flowing line.

Their depth and stacking are tuned as shading devices, reducing direct solar gain while producing a measured cadence of light and shadow across the façade.

The front works as a protective band that absorbs the slope and manages privacy, while the rear opens and lightens toward the view. Two first-floor wings stretch outward as calibrated cantilevers over the garden, widening the horizon line and drawing in air and sky. Along the existing retaining wall, a ravine-like courtyard is carved to bring daylight and planting into the deeper parts of the plan—spaces that would otherwise sit pressed into the hillside. At the peak, an additional level houses a private office positioned between two outlooks: the north-west hills and the south-east city skyline.'

A concrete bridge then crosses the courtyard cut into the foyer, with a sunken zen garden below easing the transition from street to interior. From the foyer, the house opens into a double-volume living and dining hall aligned to water and view, extending to a cantilevered balcony facing the hills. One level down, set into the slope, a multipurpose hall supports gatherings and entertainment, connecting directly to the pool deck and a landscaped platform. Lifted on concrete stilts over the rear terrain, this platform preserves the site’s original ground while still allowing a full-sized backyard to read as a continuous plane.'

A final ascent leads to the office level and a service balcony oriented to the city. Internally, warm timber joinery and porcelain flooring temper the concrete, while angled walls and faceted slabs keep the architecture responsive to slope and sun. Over time, weathering deepens the building’s character, allowing the house to settle into its hillside setting with increasing ease.'

A repeated hierarchy of arches becomes the project’s primary device—not as mere application, but as structure and thickness. The arch is allowed to wrap, deepen, and stack into loggias, verandas, and covered walkways, giving the compound a continuous facade depth that can register climate, privacy, and movement without relying on excess detail.'

The approach along the street draws visitors into the compound’s central clearing at the roundabout, where covered arcades establish edges and guide the turn toward each wing. The three-storey clubhouse is held as the heavier anchor, its verandas and recessed openings forming a slow, shaded perimeter; opposite, the wellness wing reads lower and calmer, fronted by a long arcade that continues the same grammar at a more horizontal scale. Behind the wellness centre, the pool terrace is kept more private—screened from the street by the building’s depth, and framed by the repeated arches as a sheltered horizon of shade.'

In daylight, the plastered surfaces become legible through their shadow profiles; at night, warm light catches the curved soffits and turns each arch into a luminous crescent reflected across water . The result is a calm, navigable ensemble: Mediterranean in atmosphere, local in its construction logic.'

The current compound is anchored by a central rotunda and a rectilinear wing, stitched by a curved concrete volume with broad glazing and horizontal stainless-steel louvers beneath a sweeping roof-line. Set boldly against the steep terrain, the original massing is weighty and assured; the new work is asked to expand the home while giving the overall assemblage a more elastic relationship to landscape and daily life. The client—an avid art collector with an affinity for Warhol—also required the extension to function as a setting where artwork, circulation, and social rituals can be read clearly.'

New floor plates thicken and thin into ribbon-like bands that step outward as deep verandahs, then retract to release pockets of air and light. As these bands continue into the newly acquired adjacent plot, they begin to “fray”—offsets, cantilevers, and sectional shifts introduce controlled variation, allowing the extension to read as a looped trajectory that returns toward the front while loosening the boundary between interior and terrain.'

The gallery is organised as a serpentine run of viewing bays along the courtyard edge, where white walls and timber floors hold a quiet, continuous field for display. Gentle turns pace the encounter into a sequence—close at hand, then re-read across the void—so the works register through distance, light, and context rather than immediacy alone. Daylight is admitted from above and softened by planting to control glare and reflection. In this sense, the architecture does not compete with the art; it operates as a measured frame, making the conditions of looking—context, pacing, and return—part of the experience.'

Lightweight glazed bridges reconnect these upper levels back to the existing house, keeping the crossings legible and the old and new distinct. At the centre, a multi-storey courtyard acts as the climatic and spatial organiser: a planted void ringed by galleries, bridges, and glazed rooms that pulls circulation to its perimeter and turns movement into a continuous series of framed views—down to shaded gardens, across to terraces, and up to sky-lit canopy.'

The diagonal stair personifies the overlap: an oblique concrete incision rising through the interstitial space, catching light and pulling one upward.

Paths and deck edges extend domestic life outward, softening thresholds between the built and unbuilt.

The original dwelling belonged to a familiar suburban lineage: pale rendered walls, layered pitched clay-tile roofs, and small projecting balconies supported by simple brackets.

Openings are treated as calibrated extrusions rather than generic windows. Projecting bays, slit apertures, and thickened frames register as inhabitable depth, producing privacy through geometry instead of overt enclosure. The monochrome palette sharpens the reading of shadow, making relief and recess legible across the day.
