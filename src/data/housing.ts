      { type: 'text', content: 'Bahagia Heights is shaped by a familiar residential tension: the desire to belong to a coherent neighbourhood, and the equally strong desire for a home to feel personally chosen. In terrace developments, this balance is often mishandled in two predictable ways—either a forced uniformity that flattens character, or a busy mix of one-off gestures that erodes calm. Here, the approach is deliberately measured. The development is conceived as a consistent framework that still allows each unit to register as distinct through small, legible differences rather than something performed through loud formal novelty.' },
      { type: 'text', content: 'To introduce architectural vibrancy while responding to mainstream market preferences, façades are designed in diptych pairs: two related elevations offered as a choice set, similar enough to preserve overall order, different enough to feel intentional. For the row houses, a square silhouette is repeated and split into mirrored counterparts through contrasting depth—one unit reads as an inset frame, the other as an extruded one. For the semi-detached homes, the same pairing logic is retained, but the outline shifts, with one twin taking on a gabled profile.' },
      { type: 'text', content: 'These variations are held together by clear constants. A thickened front zone—deep car porch and shaded façade depth—acts as climatic buffer and identity device. White planes and light grey surfaces keep the massing crisp under strong daylight, while timber-toned soffits warm the undercrofts and emphasise the depth that makes the elevations work. Aluminium profiles are kept consistent for continuity and build discipline. Across the street, the car porch datum aligns the frontage into a neat, readable horizon.' },
      { type: 'text', content: 'Arrival is staged at a clear perimeter threshold. A deep, tapered rectangular frame marks the entrance, with the guardhouse set beneath the canopy as an occupied checkpoint. The gate reprises the same language used within—timber soffits and vertically striped surfaces—prefacing the development as a whole. Leopard trees flank the approach and recur along internal streets, extending the landscape identity from entry to frontage.' },
      { type: 'text', content: 'Beyond the entrance, the neighbourhood shifts into a more open, community-forward pattern. The row houses adopt a deliberately gateless frontage condition, with individual access controlled at the main security gate rather than at each lot. This arrangement—seen in newer Malaysian neighbourhood models—allows the car porch to function as a social threshold instead of a defensive barrier. It supports short pauses and casual exchange, makes space for children’s play within sightlines, and encourages the small, everyday neighbourliness that gives a street its atmosphere. Deep porches provide shade and rain cover, while planting strips between lots soften the hard edge of parking and boundary elements. Large windows remain generous, with depth and landscape working together to keep interiors bright without feeling exposed.' },
      { type: 'text', content: 'Bahagia Heights is designed as a disciplined neighbourhood with calibrated choice. The diptych strategy introduces variation that is legible and market-ready, offering buyers options while maintaining a coherent streetscape. From the framed entrance to the gateless porch threshold, the project prioritises comfort, shade, and a sense of lived character—an architecture that stays consistent in its fundamentals, yet leaves room for households to differentiate themselves through use, daily rituals, and time.' },

      { type: 'text', content: 'Botanic Central is positioned within a fast-growing peri-urban corridor where commercial growth tends to arrive as familiar, repeatable shop-office blocks: wide service roads, recessed canopies, and full-width glazing that is later overwhelmed by ad-hoc signboards and banners. The prevalence of this typology exposes a disciplinary gap—signage is rarely given an architectural place, so tenants colonise every available surface, flattening the façade into visual noise while masking glazing that should support display, daylight, and ventilation. This project accepts the two-storey shop-office as an efficient urban instrument, then refines its public face by treating branding as a designed layer rather than an afterthought.' },
      { type: 'text', content: 'The precinct is organised by rhythm, depth, and a clear signage hierarchy. Bold cubic upper volumes act as calibrated frames to the street, thickening the façade into legible planes sized to host tenant identity without spilling into openings. A three-tier system is embedded within this composition: primary tenant panels are reserved on the main upper planes for high-visibility identification; a continuous secondary sign band is aligned as a consistent datum for smaller names and wayfinding; and vertical lot markers are confined to recesses and party-wall seams to register individual units and stairs. By fixing where graphics may land, the architecture preserves windows as windows and signage as signage—improving readability from the road while protecting façade performance from the common cycle of over-application.' },
      { type: 'text', content: 'Arrival is staged through a clear hierarchy of markers and edges, where a darker base plane anchors the row, accommodating shutters, entries, and shopfronts as a robust, serviceable datum. Ground-floor glazing is protected as the commercial interface, kept clear of primary signage so display and visibility remain intact, while louvres and deep reveals moderate sun and glare. Across the elevation, the white blocks are set in a four-step height variation—enough to give each unit a distinct beat and a livelier streetscape, while remaining robust and repeatable for cost control and long-term coherence.' },
      { type: 'text', content: 'Above, upper-floor openings are set back and screened to reduce heat gain and glare, and to remain visually subordinate to the primary sign fields. The façade therefore performs as a controlled framework: it grants tenants generous branding capacity, but only within zones that preserve legibility, protect glazing, and maintain a coherent street edge over time.' },
      { type: 'text', content: 'Botanic Central therefore delivers a retail environment that is functional, legible, and resilient. By formalising the shop-office typology through shading depth and an integrated signage framework, the precinct can accommodate tenant turnover without visual disorder, holding a clear architectural identity within the everyday flux of commercial life.' },
