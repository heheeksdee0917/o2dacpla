The site is read less as a street edge than as an open commons: a lawn edged by trees, crossed by simple paths, and complemented by adjacent covered courts. In this setting, the hall must operate as both destination and backdrop, offering shelter for informal waiting and socialising, and an interior that can absorb the density of weddings, cultural celebrations, and community assemblies. Rather than compete with the openness of the field, the building gives it an address—an inhabitable edge of shade, threshold, and gathering.'

Between these folds, narrow vertical slots admit controlled daylight and break the long elevations into shaded intervals. Deep roof edges and continuous eaves extend the protective perimeter, keeping circulation usable during downpours and tempering glare in midday sun. A timber-lined entry volume is inserted as a warmer counterpoint, turning the façade into a civic proscenium, where the hall’s identity is articulated through an abstracted Chinese register: an inclined signboard, layered timber screens, and a lifted eave line align into a legible ceremonial frontage.'

The timber portal compresses the threshold, then releases into a tall, column-free interior—scaled for collective occupation rather than fixed seating. A robust ceiling grid, high-level openings, and clear floor geometry allow the room to shift quickly between badminton games, banquet settings, community briefings, and festive performances. A stage anchors one end as a constant point of orientation, while service bands and side stairs are consolidated to keep the hall clear, adaptable, and straightforward to manage during large events.'
